# deep learning for computer vision model to skeletonize digital filaments images

The skeletonization is a well known mophological operation, studied several years ago, with recent computer vision advances, this technique become to be extecuted by recent deep learning methods.

The purpose of this repository will be to convert digital images with filaments into its skeletonize representation.

For that, primarily we will use the well know architecture named U-Net, and for training stage, we will user our simulated images, OFDA images, and other datasets found.
